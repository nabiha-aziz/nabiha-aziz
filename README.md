### Hey, I'm Nabiha! :grin:

## What is this?

This is my HUG, my human user guide. It will tell you a little bit about me and how I work :) 


## About me 

I grew up in Hamilton, ON (Steel city!). I graduated from the Mathematics program at the University of Waterloo in 2022. I love playing sports, fitness, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. I grew up doing all things creative - drawing, painting, and music. 

Through my itch for creativity, I discovered the world of UX/UI design. Combining the design side with my technical mathematical background, I became passionate about developing user friendly platforms to solve real world problems. 


## Personal Principles and Values 

- Working hard combined with doing the very best you can 
* Helping others and letting yourself be helped 
+ Taking care of yourself - your mind and body
- Be kind to others and yourself :) 
* There’s always more to learn - stay humble
+ A strong and passionate team is the foundation of valuable products 


## Q&A

### What energizes you?
Music, a social office space, running, a project that I’m passionate about!

### What depletes your energy?
Getting no fresh air and meetings I have no purpose in.  

### Introvert or extrovert?
I’m a BIG introvert and I’m pretty shy. But I love to get to know people and chat once I get comfortable! 

### What is your approach to problem solving? Research or dive in?
A combination of both for sure. I like being organized and prepared before starting a task, since I find that doing that allows me to dive in more efficiently. 

### When are you most productive?
On a day to day basis, I am probably the most productive from 10-4. However, if I get really into a task I can be productive all day and all night. 

### How do you like to receive feedback?
I like receiving kind and constructive feedback, I know that there is still a lot for me to learn as a fresh grad! 

### What are your pet peeves?
Sitting in a chair all day (going on walks every now and then is key!), a dull office environment, meetings that waste time.

### Are you open to mentoring others? On what topics?
I would love to mentor others in UX/UI design!

### Are you looking to be mentored? On what topics?
There are so many topics I would love to advance in: back end development and databases in particular. 

### Technologies you like / dislike?
I’m not too picky technology-wise, but I really like Figma and Adobe XD in terms of UX/UI technology.

I seem quiet/shy but I would love to chat! Feel free to send me a message :)
